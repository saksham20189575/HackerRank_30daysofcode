/*
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i,d ,s and  are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

1 Declare  variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2 Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your variables.
3 Use the  operator to perform the following operations: 
> Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
> Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
> Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
